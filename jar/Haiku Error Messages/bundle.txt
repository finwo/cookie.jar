        First snow, then silence.

        Stay the patient course
        Of little worth is your ire
        The network is down

        A crash reduces
        your expensive computer
        to a simple stone.

        Yesterday it worked
        Today it is not working
        Windows is like that

        Three things are certain:
        Death, taxes, and lost data.
        Guess which has occurred.

        Having been erased,
        The document you're seeking
        Must now be retyped.

        Rather than a beep
        Or a rude error message,
        These words: "File not found."

        Serious error.
        All shortcuts have disappeared.
        Screen. Mind. Both are blank.
