gets right back on you, I think you should buck him off right away.

Anytime I see something screech across a room and latch onto
someones neck, and the guy screams and tries to get it off, I
have to laugh, because what is that thing.

We used to laugh at Grandpa when he'd head off and go fishing.
But we wouldn't be laughing that evening when he'd come back with
some whore he picked up in town.

I wish a robot would get elected president.  That way, when he
came to town, we could all take a shot at him and not feel too bad.

As the evening sky faded from a salmon color to a sort of flint gray, I
thought back to the salmon I caught that morning, and how gray he was,
and how I named him Flint.

If you're a young Mafia gangster out on your first date, I bet it's real
embarrassing if someone tries to kill you.

Whenever I see an old lady slip and fall on a wet sidewalk, my first
instinct is to laugh.  But then I think, what if I was an ant, and she
fell on me.  Then it wouldn't seem quite so funny.

If you go parachuting, and your parachute doesn't open, and your
friends are all watching you fall, I think a funny gag would be to

When I was a kid my favorite relative was Uncle Caveman.  After school
we'd all go play in his cave, and every once in a while he would eat
one of us.  It wasn't until later that I found out that Uncle Caveman
was a bear.

I think people tend to forget that trees are living creatures.

dark side, and it holds the universe together."

Boys' rooms are usually messy. Girls' rooms are usually messy,
except it's a good smelling mess.

From the collection Boys and Girls are Equal, but Not The Same:
A baby girl will pick up a stick and look in wonderment at what
nature has made. A baby boy will pick up a stick and turn it
into a gun.

From the collection Boys and Girls are Equal, but Not The Same:
When girls play with Barbie and Ken dolls, they like to dress
them up and play house with them. When boys play with Barbie
and Ken dolls, they like to tear off their appendages.

From the collection Boys and Girls are Equal, but Not The Same:
Boys couldn't care less if their hair is unruly. If their bangs
got cut a quarter-inch too short, girls would rather lock
themselves in their room for two weeks than be seen in public.

From the collection Boys and Girls are Equal, but Not The Same:
Baby girls find mommy's makeup and almost instintively start
painting their face. Baby boys find mommy's makeup and almost
instinctively start painting the walls.

From the collection Boys and Girls are Equal, but Not The Same:
If a girl accidently burps, she will be embarrassed. If a boy
accidently burps, he will follow it with a dozen fake belches.

From the collection Boys and Girls are Equal, but Not The Same:
Boys grow their fingernails long because because they're too
lazy to cut them. Girls grow their fingernails long - not
because they look nice - but because they can dig them into a
boy's arm.

From the collection Boys and Girls are Equal, but Not The Same:
Girls are attracted to boys, even at an early s. By the
age of 6, girls will stop giving their dad kisses unless he
bribes them with candy.

From the collection Boys and Girls are Equal, but Not The Same:
Most baby girls talk before boys do. Before boys talk, they
learn how to make machine-gun noises.

From the collection Boys and Girls are Equal, but Not The Same:
Girls will cry if someone dies in a movie. Boys will cry if you
turn off the VCR after they've watched "Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles" three times in a row.

From the collection Boys and Girls are Equal, but Not The Same:
Girls turn into women. Boys turn into bigger boys.

Conscience is the inner voice that warns us somebody may be

Any people will walk in and out of your life, but true friends
will leave footprints in your heart. Be sure to remember that
when you have your first heart attack.

To handle yourself, use your head. To handle others, use your
heart. To handle the clutch, use your left foot.

Anger is only one letter short of danger. Die is only one
letter short of diet. Mother is only one letter short of
smother.

If someone betrays you once, it's his fault. If he betrays you
twice, it's your fault. If he betrays you three times, you have
really poor taste in friends.

Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small
minds discuss people. People with no minds rewrite
inspirational posts and send their new versions out over the
Internet.

God gives the birds their food, but he does not throw it into
their nest. He makes them go down to the ground first, where
the cat can get at them.

He who loses money, loses much; he who loses a friend, loses
more; he who loses faith, loses all. He who loses bladder
control might as well just call it a day.

Learn from the mistakes of others. You can't live long enough
to make them all yourself.

The tongue weighs practically nothing, but so few people can
hold it.

A little wisdom goes a long way. A whole lot of wisdom usually
just drives the recipient nuts.

Real Programmers consider "what you see is what you get" to
be just as bad a concept in text editors as it is in women.
No, the Real Programmer wants a "you asked for it, you got
it" text editor -- complicated, cryptic, powerful,
