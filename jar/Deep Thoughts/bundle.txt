"To understand a man, you should walk a mile in his shoes.
 If he's still bothered by what you say, it's okay, because
 you will be a mile away and you will have his shoes."

"It's sad that a famieces of coral,
 which have been painted brown and attached to the skull
 by common wood screws, can make a child look like a deer."

From the Deep Thoughts collection:
"I think people tend to forget that trees are living

 motionless dogs, with bark instead of fur."

From the Deep Thoughts collection:
"Is there anything more beautiful than a beautiful, beautiful
flamingo, flying across in front of a beautiful sunset?  And he's
carrying a very beautiful rose in his beak, and also he's carrying a

From the Deep Thoughts collection:
"Even though he was an enemy of mine, I had to admit that what he had
accomplished was a brilliant piece of strategy.  First, he punched me,
then he kicked me, then he punched me again."

From the Deep Thoughts collection:

 because you'd probably be proud to be sprayed by one."

From the Deep Thoughts collection:
"I bet a fun thing would be to go way back in time to where there was
going to be an eclipse and tell the ave men, "If I have come to
destroy you, may the sun be blotted out from the sky." Just then the
eclipse would start, and they'd probably try to kill you or something,

everyone would get a good laugh."

From the Deep Thoughts collection:
"Perhaps, if I am very lucky, the feeble efforts of my lifetime will
someday be noticed, and maybe, in some small way, they will be
acknowledged as the greatest works of genius ever created by Man."
