Maybe in order to understand mankind, we have to look at the
word itself: "Mankind".  Basically, it's made up of two separate
words - "mank" and "ind". What do these words mean?
It's a mystery, and that's why so is mankind.

I hope if dogs ever take over the world, and they chose a king,
they don't just go by size, because I bet there are some Chihuahuas
with some good ideas.

It takes a big man to cry, but it takes a bigger man to laugh at that man.

I guess we were all guilty, in a way.  We all shot him, we all
skinned him, and we all got a complimentary bumper sticker that said,
"I helped skin Bob."

I bet the main reason the police keep people away from a plane
crash is they don't want anybody walking in and lying down in the
crash stuff, then, when somebody comes up, act like they just
woke up and go, "What was THAT?!"

The face of a child can say it all,
especially the mouth part of the face.

Ambition is like a frog sitting on a Venus Flytrap.  The flytrap
can bite and bite, but it won't bother the frog because it only
has little tiny plant teeth.  But some other stuff could happen
and it could be like ambition.

I'd rather be rich than stupid.  If you were a poor Indian with
no weapons, and a bunch of conquistadors came up to you and asked
where the gold was, I don't think it would be a good idea to say,
"I swallowed it.  So sue me."

If you define cowardice as running away at the first sign of danger,
screaming and tripping and begging for mercy, then yes, Mr. Brave man,
I guess I'm a coward.

I bet one legend that keeps recurring throughout history,
in every culture, is the story of Popeye.

When you go in for a job interview, I think a good
thing to ask is if they ever press charges.

To me, boxing is like a ballet, except there's no
music, no choreography, and the dancers hit each other.

What is it that makes a complete stranger dive into an icy
river to save a solid gold babreal sad.  Also, he has severe
diarrhea.

If you're a horse, and someone gets on you, and falls off, and then
gets right back on you, I think you should buck him off right away.

If you ever teach a yodeling class, probably the hardest thing is
to keep the students from just trying to yodel right off.  You see,
we build to that.

If you ever fall off the Sears Tower, just go real limp, because
maybe you'll look like a dummy and people will try to catch you
because, hey, free dummy.

I'd like to see a nude opera, because when they hit those high notes,
I bet you can really see it in those genitals.

Anytime I see something screech across a room and latch onto
someones neck, and the guy screams and tries to get it off, I
have to laugh, because what is that thing.

If a kid asks where rain comes from, I think a cute thing to tell
him is "God is crying." And if he asks why God is crying, another
cute thing to tell him is "Probably because of something you did."

Contrary to what most people say, the most dangerous animal in the
world is not the lion or the tiger or even the elephant.  It's a shark
riding on an elephant's back, just trampling and eating everything
they see.

If you saw two guys named Hambone and Flippy, which one would you
think liked dolphins the most?  I'd say Flippy, wouldn't you? You'd
be wrong, though. It's Hambone.

Laurie got offended that I used the word "puke." But to me, that's
what her dinner tasted like.

We used to laugh at Grandpa when he'd head off and go fishing.
But we wouldn't be laughing that evening when he'd come back with
some whore he picked up in town.

I wish a robot would get elected president.  That way, when he
came to town, we could all take a shot at him and not feel too bad.

As the evening sky faded from a salmon color to a sort of flint gray, I
thought back to the salmon I caught that morning, and how gray he was,
and how I named him Flint.

If you're a young Mafia gangster out on your first date, I bet it's real
embarrassing if someone tries to kill you.

Whenever I see an old lady slip and fall on a wet sidewalk, my first
instinct is to laugh.  But then I think, what if I was an ant, and she
fell on me.  Then it wouldn't seem quite so funny.

If you go parachuting, and your parachute doesn't open, and your
friends are all watching you fall, I think a funny gag would be to
pretend you were swimming.

When I was a kid my favorite relative was Uncle Caveman.  After school
we'd all go play in his cave, and every once in a while he would eat
one of us.  It wasn't until later that I found out that Uncle Caveman
was a bear.

I think people tend to forget that trees are living creatures.
They're sort of like dogs.  Huge, quiet, motionless dogs, with bark
instead of fur.

Carl Zwanzig: "Duct tape is like the Force:  It has a light side, a
dark side, and it holds the universe together."

Douglas Adams: "There is a theory that if ever anybody discovers
exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly
disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and
inexplicable.  There is another theory that his has already happened."

Albert Einstein: "Only two things are infinite, the universe and human
stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former."

Unknown: "Astronomers say the universe is finite, which is a
comforting thought for those people who can't remember where they
leave things."

Edward P. Tryon: "In answer to the question of why it happened, I
offer the modest proposal that our Universe is simply one of those
things which happen from time to time."

Rich Cook: "Programming today is a race between software engineers
striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the
Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots.  So far, the
Universe is winning."

Fred Hoyle: "There is a coherent plan in the universe, though I don't
know what it's a plan for."

Ray Bradbury: "We are an impossibility in an impossible universe."

Christopher Morley: "My theology, briefly, is that the universe was
dictated but not signed."

Edward Chilton: "I'm worried that the universe will soon need
replacing. It's not holding a charge."

Calvin and Hobbes (Bill Watterson): "The surest sign that intelligent

Conscience is the inner voice that warns us somebody may be
looking.

Any people will walk in and out of your life, but true friends
will leave footprints in your heart. Be sure to remember that
when you have your first heart attack.

To handle yourself, use your head. To handle others, use your
heart. To handle the clutch, use your left foot.

Anger is only one letter short of danger. Die is only one
letter short of diet. Mother is only one letter short of
smother.

If someone betrays you once, it's his fault. If he betrays you
twice, it's your fault. If he betrays you three times, you have
really poor taste in friends.

Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small
minds discuss people. People with no minds rewrite
inspirational posts and send their new versions out over the
Internet.

God gives the birds their food, but he does not throw it into
their nest. He makes them go down to the ground first, where
the cat can get at them.

He who loses money, loses much; he who loses a friend, loses
more; he who loses faith, loses all. He who loses bladder
control might as well just call it a day.

Learn from the mistakes of others. You can't live long enough
to make them all yourself.

The tongue weighs practically nothing, but so few people can
hold it.

A little wisdom goes a long way. A whole lot of wisdom usually
just drives the recipient nuts.

Real Programmers consider "what you see is what you get" to
be just as bad a concept in text editors as it is in women.
No, the Real Programmer wants a "you asked for it, you got
it" text editor -- complicated, cryptic, powerful,
unforgiving, dangerous.

LACTOMANGULATION (lak' to man guy lay' shun) n. Manhandling the

Rome did not create a great empire by having meetings...
they did it by killing all those who opposed them.

No.  That's it.  The cool name, that is.  We worked very
hard on creating a name that would appeal to the
majority of people, and it certainly paid off: thousands
of people are using linux just to be able to say "OS/2?
